Task to complete today:
1. Password validator like it should not be the userId, it should have digits alphabets (atleast 1 lowercase and 1 uppercase and 1 special character) It should not be like easy password or any dicitonary names. ✅
2. From the pdf we need to remove the external marks things as we dont give the marks of the external to students. directly sgpa and cgpa is shown to the students so if we want then we can make a chart of cgpa and cgpa for each sem. ❗

[THE ABOVE FETAURE IS ON STAND BY POSITION AS THIS FEATURE NEEDS TO BE DISCUUSED WITH FAULT AND HOD THAT HOW THE MARKS ARE CALUCLATED]

3. RBAC: when faculty needs to enter the marks they need to take the access or permission from the HOD or higher authority and then they can do that thing. Once HOD gives the permission faculty can proccess further with the entering of the marks. ✅
4. Accessing of the marks / markssheet. When faculty or HOD are accessing the marks then there should not be asking for the password but if student want to then it should ask for password. ✅
