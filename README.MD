Task to complete today:
1. From the pdf we need to remove the external marks things as we dont give the marks of the external to students. directly sgpa and cgpa is shown to the students so if we want then we can make a chart of cgpa and cgpa for each sem. ❗

[THE ABOVE FETAURE IS ON STAND BY POSITION AS THIS FEATURE NEEDS TO BE DISCUUSED WITH FAULT AND HOD THAT HOW THE MARKS ARE CALUCLATED]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Creating all authentication plus redirecting to the respective dashboard page in frontend.
[Showing Errors in almost every page is remaining via react-hot-toasts]. ✅

3. Design the all of the 3 dashboards (Student, Faculty, HOD).

4. Show the Working data of all the dashboards (Student, Faculty, HOD).

5. All the urls for redirecting in te frontend needs to be globalized variable as that variable should be used as base URL everywhere rather then writing whole url evrytime



Things rmaining:
1. Via manual entry work of marks ✅
2. excel done ✅
